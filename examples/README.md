# libcanard examples

These are simple examples of DroneCAN nodes using libcanard and the
dronecan_dsdlc DSDL compiler

For more a more complete firmware framework please see the ArduPilot
AP_Periph firmware framework

## Building Examples

To build each of the examples cd to the subdirectory of the example
and type 'make'

You may need to install the following before building:
```
  sudo pip install empy pydronecan pexpect
```

## Running Examples

Before you run the examples you need to start socketcan on Linux. See
the setup_socketcan.sh script in this directory for starting socketcan

![setup_socketcan.sh](setup_socketcan.jpg "setup_socketcan.sh")

After socketcan is setup you can run an example like this:
```
 ./esc_node vcan0
```
Then connect to vcan0 with the DroneCAN GUI Tool.

![gui_connect_vcan0](gui_connect_vcan0.jpg "gui_connect_vcan0")

After starting the GUI tool you need to assign a node ID to the GUI
tool itself by ticking the local node ID selection

![gui_tick](gui_tick.jpg "gui_tick")

For the esc_node and servo_node you will need a dynamic node
allocation server, which you can start within the DroneCAN GUI tool
using the rocket icon in the bottom right corner

![gui_DNA](gui_DNA.jpg "gui_DNA")

This will result in a CAN node ID being allocated and the node showing
up on the bus.

Your new CAN node will now show up in the GUI tool.
